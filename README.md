# LeaderBoard

##Case

It is the Leaderboard project designed for the weekly reward system of players who play a game. Players earn money every week based on their in-game activity. 2% of the total winnings are collected in the prize pool and the top 100 players get their share of the money in this pool at the end of the week.


##Technologies

In the project, NodeJS V12 technologies were used for the server project and ReactJS V17 technologies were used for the client project. Work has been done to have MongoDB data source in the project, but it is not available at the moment. The remaining work in the past commits is stopped. Loadbalancing structure was intended to be installed, but due to AWS issues, it is currently on the TODO list. You can see a simple load-balancing example in the link I gave below.
